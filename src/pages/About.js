                Hello there! My name is Adam and I've found my calling in the
                vibrant world of web and mobile technology at the University of
                the Incarnate Word. Here, I'm not just coding or designing; I'm
                reimagining how we interact with digital spaces. In addition to
                being passionate about technology, I'm also a devoted husband
                and a proud new father to a 4-month-old. Balancing my family
                life with my professional endeavors has enriched my perspective,
                enhancing my creativity and problem-solving skills. My tech
                toolbox includes Javascript, FileZilla, SiteImprove, Cascade CMS, React, XML,
                JSON, Express, AWS Lambda, Git, Microsoft Azure, Algolia,
                Ellucian Experience SDK, MaterialUI, Bootstrap, NodeJS, GraphQL,
                Canva, Photoshop, and Insomnia. For me, it's not just about the
                tools. It's about creating user-friendly tech marvels. I believe
                the best tech solutions are those that feel natural and
                intuitive â€“ almost like they've always been a part of our lives.
                Collaboration is key in my book. I've always been a fan of
                brainstorming sessions where ideas bounce off the walls, and
                everyone has a voice. It's amazing what we can come up with when
                we put our minds together!
