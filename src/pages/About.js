      <p>
        Hello there! My name is Adam and I've found my calling in the vibrant
        world of web and mobile technology at the University of the Incarnate
        Word. Here, I'm not just coding or designing; I'm reimagining how we
        interact with digital spaces. I love diving into projects headfirst,
        whether it's bringing a new app to life or finding a fresh twist on a
        website. It's all about making things that people love to use. My tech
        toolbox includes Javascript, Cascade CMS, AWS Lambda, Git, Microsoft
        Azure, Algolia, MaterialUI, Bootstrap, NodeJS, GraphQL, Canva,
        Photoshop, and React. For me, it's not just about the tools. Its about
        creating user-friendly tech marvels. I believe the best tech solutions
        are those that feel natural and intuitive â€“ almost like they've always
        been a part of our lives. Collaboration is key in my book and I've
        always been a fan of brainstorming sessions where ideas bounce off the
        walls, and everyone has a voice. It's amazing what we can come up with
        when we put our minds together!
